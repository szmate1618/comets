# MetaServer

This is a simple Flask server for user registration/login/storing user meta data not actually present in the game.
Necessary development tools are Python3, pip3, venv (included in Python 3.4 or newer), and Flask, of course.
Should you add any new dependencies, please use venv, and update requirements.txt,
preferably by a `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` command.
